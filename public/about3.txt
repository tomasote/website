I have always loved working with people. It does not matter if they are little kids, customers or drunk people. There is something really rewarding with providing good customer service and when you feel that you have made someones day. Although these jobs differ a lot from what I am aspiring to be today, I think it is really important to be a social person, for both professional and personal reasons. This is an experience I value highly and something I will bring with me when entering the future.
