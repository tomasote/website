Let's not expect the most impressive experience section here, ok? Keep in mind I am barely a junior. The only experience I have is from school where I have learned multiple languages, such as Java, Python, C, and Haskell along with some HTML, CSS and Assembly. I have also tried to learn GoLang, JavaScript and Dart but not spent much time on these. Out of all these languages, my favorite is Python due to its easily read code and swift development process. For two different school projects I have developed a back-end with help of the Django framework for Python. I was responsible for designing the database, setting up the different routes, implementing reasonable security and setting up a proper hosting for the server. That is basically the development experience I have. However, I have learned a lot of math necessary for fields like artificial intelligence, algorithms and data structures and data analysis.
