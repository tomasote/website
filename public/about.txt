My name is Tomas PÃ©rez and I am 23 years old from Uppsala, Sweden. I am currently a year 4 student on the M.Sc. Eng. in Information Technology programme at Uppsala University where I am majoring in software development. I prefer to work with developing back-ends rather than front-ends, since I find most languages/frameworks for front-end development quite confusing, hence the product that is this website. Just parsing and rendering this .txt file that you are reading right now was a pain. Therefore, I prefer working with back-end. I do however like learning new things, which is why I tried designing this website.
